# Image Dehazing with Boundary Constraint and Contextual Regularization

## Description

This project focuses on the implementation and enhancement of a novel method for single image dehazing. The proposed method combines a boundary constraint with a weighted L1-norm based contextual regularization to estimate the unknown scene transmission, aiming to remove hazes from a single input image efficiently and effectively.

This project is Implementation of Research Paper.  [Paper-PDF](/Documents/Implemented_Research_Paper.pdf)

## Features

This Project contains following Features :

- Basic Tkinter UI to get image dehazing results of hazy image.
- PSNR(Peak Signal to Noise Ration) : The calculation of noise removal of hazy image.
- SSIM(Structural Similarity Index) : The Structural calculation of dehaze image in context of Luminance and Contrast.

## Installation

To test the working of the project, follow these installation steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/P6s-fx/Image-Dehazing-with-Boundary-Constraint-and-Contextual-Regularization.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries if you haven't already.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

- Launch the application using the installation steps mentioned above.
- Use the user-friendly interface to dehaze Hazy Image.
- Check PSNR and SSIM from the Terminal to analyze the dehazing.
